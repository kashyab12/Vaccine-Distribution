        Calculate the derivative of the compartment with respect to

        ## **Parameters**
        
        `time`: Time to take the derivative at. Similar to `time` 
                parameter in `epispot.models.Model.diff`.
        
        `system`: A list containing the system of compartment values.
                  Should be of the same shape as the `starting_state` 
                  parameter of `epispot.models.Model.integrate`.
        
        `pos`: The index of the compartment in the `comps` parameter of 
               `epispot.models.Model`.
        
        `minimap`: This compartment's connections. Essentially, a slice
                   of the larger `map` parameter of 
                   `epispot.models.Model`.

        `minimatrix`: A slice of the `matrix` parameter of 
                      `epispot.models.Model` specific to this 
                      compartment.
